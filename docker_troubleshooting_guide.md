# Docker Troubleshooting Guide

Welcome to the Docker Troubleshooting Guide! If you encounter issues during the setup or while using Docker, this guide will help you find solutions to common problems.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Docker Desktop Fails to Start
- **Cause:** There might be an issue with the installation or system requirements.
- **Solution:** 
  - Ensure your system meets the [Docker Desktop requirements](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#system-requirements).
  - Restart your computer and try launching Docker again.
  - Check for updates and install the latest version of Docker Desktop.

### 2. Unable to Run Docker Commands
- **Cause:** Your user may not have permission to run Docker commands.
- **Solution:** 
  - On Linux, add your user to the docker group:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
  - Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

### 3. "Cannot Connect to the Docker Daemon"
- **Cause:** The Docker daemon may not be running.
- **Solution:** 
  - Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
  - Restart the Docker service with the following command (Linux):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

### 4. Error: "WSL 2 backend is not installed"
- **Cause:** The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) is not installed or not enabled.
- **Solution:** 
  - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```
  - Restart your computer.

### 5. Docker Not Responding or Slow Performance
- **Cause:** Insufficient system resources allocated to Docker.
- **Solution:** 
  - Increase the memory and CPU allocation in Docker Desktop settings under **Resources**.
  - Ensure other resource-intensive applications are closed.

### 6. Network Issues with Containers
- **Cause:** Docker's default network settings may conflict with existing network configurations.
- **Solution:** 
  - Try resetting the Docker network settings in Docker Desktop under **Settings > Network**.
  - Check your firewall settings to ensure Docker can access the network.
