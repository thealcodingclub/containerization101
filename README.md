# Introduction to Docker & Containerization Workshop

Welcome to the Docker basics workshop! This guide will help you set up everything you need before we begin. Don't worry if you're new to all of this - we'll take it step by step.

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
1. **Docker Desktop**
   - For Windows: [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - For Mac: [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - For Linux: Follow the [Docker Engine installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. **Git**
   - Windows: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/windows)
   - Mac: Install via Terminal using `brew install git` (requires [Homebrew](https://brew.apple.com/))
   - Linux: `sudo apt-get install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install git` (CentOS/RHEL)



### Verifying Your Installation

After installing Docker, open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Verify Docker is running properly
docker run hello-world
```

If both commands run successfully, you're ready for the workshop!
